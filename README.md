# Hey, I'm Aviral ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a high school student from India with a keen interest in programming, especially for physics simulations.
- I'm familiar with Python, JS, HTML, CSS, and C++
- I'm also experienced with web development. Some of my projects include [my website](https://avirald.me) and a [website for a research organisation](https://astra-research.github.io/website).
- Some of my physics utilities involve a [solver for the Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation](https://avirald.me/brans-dicke-calculator/) and [a script to compute all quantities pertaining to the Fermi-Dirac distribution](https://github.com/harrypotter12352/fermi-dirac-calculator)
